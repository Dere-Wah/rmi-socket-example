# disclaimer

this is an example project for the implementation of RMI & Socket networking in java.

it was not created by me, and all the credits are in the readme.pdf file.

i have simply uploaded this to github for easier referencing and sharing.

it is not part in any ways to the private project of my group's 2025 Software Engineering Project.
